# The Genesis Protocol

## Immigracious: A Zero-Person Company Built on AI-Native Principles

## I. The Bamboo Principle

> *"The bamboo that bends is stronger than the oak that resists."*
> *— Japanese Proverb*

Bamboo spends 5 years building its root system underground. Then it grows 90 feet in 6 weeks.

This protocol describes how we build the root system—the invisible infrastructure of research, truth, market sensing, and strategic clarity—before explosive growth becomes inevitable.

### Core Operating Principles

1. **Temporal Metacognition**: At every turn, know where you are in time. What changed since last session? What's the current market truth? What assumptions need re-verification?

2. **Obligatory Truth-Seeking**: Never assume. Always verify. Use exa-search before claiming market facts. The world changes daily.

3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple. Add complexity only when earned. Don't build infrastructure for scale before product-market fit.

4. **Kindness as Strategy**: Immigration is emotional. Users are vulnerable. Lead with empathy. Design with grace. Build trust through genuine care.

5. **Design Supremacy**: In a commoditized AI world, UX is the moat. Be the Linear/Fey of immigration. Make complex feel simple.

2. 10 real interview questions with AI adjudicator
3. Basic feedback/scoring
4. No auth, no database, no scale—just value validation

**Validation Criteria:**
- [ ] 10 users complete a full mock interview
- [ ] NPS > 50
- [ ] "Would you pay $X?" > 60% yes
- [ ] Qualitative: "This is better than practicing alone"

**Deliverables:**
- Working prototype (deployed, shareable)
- User feedback synthesis
- Iteration backlog
- `research/02-sprouting/VALIDATION_REPORT.md`

---

2. **Product**: Features that increase session frequency
3. **Referral**: "Practice with your spouse" viral loop
4. **Trust**: Success stories, testimonials, credentials

**Metrics:**
- Monthly Active Users (MAU)

## IV. Temporal Metacognition Rituals

### Daily Truth-Seeking
Before any work session:
```
1. exa-search: "[topic] news last 24 hours"
2. Check: What assumptions from yesterday are still true?
3. Update: knowledge graph with new learnings
4. Prioritize: Based on current truth, not stale plans
```

### Weekly Synthesis
```
1. What did we learn this week?
2. What surprised us?
3. What do we need to unlearn?
4. What's the one thing that matters most next week?
```

### Phase Gate Reviews
Before advancing phases:
```
1. Did we achieve the key question's answer?
2. What evidence supports moving forward?
3. What risks are we accepting?
4. Board (Mathieu) approval checkpoint
```

## V. The Immigracious Promise

To every immigrant who practices with us:

> *We see you. We understand the weight of this moment—the years of paperwork, the sleepless nights, the dreams hanging in the balance of a 15-minute interview.*
>
> *We built this because someone should have built it sooner. Because you deserve to walk into that interview confident, prepared, and practiced.*
>
> *We're not lawyers. We can't guarantee outcomes. But we can give you the one thing that reduces anxiety more than anything else: preparation.*
>
> *Welcome to Immigracious. Let's practice.*
