### 3.4 Recommended Approach

**Start with Tier 2, propose path to Tier 4.**

**The Pitch:**
> "Ashwin, you personally prepped me for my green card interview in 2015. That call changed everything for me. Now I'm building a product to give others what you gave me—but I need your expertise to make sure we do it right.
>
> I'm not asking for much of your time. Here's what I'm thinking:
>
> **Phase 1 (Now):** One quarterly call + email access. I'll pay you $500/quarter. You review our content, flag anything wrong, and we credit you as our legal advisor.
>
> **Phase 2 (If this works):** We grow this into a video series where you're the face of authority. I handle everything—production, editing, posting. You just show up and share what you know. Could be $30K+/year with revenue share.
>
> You helped me when I couldn't afford to pay. This is my way of building something that helps thousands while making sure the attorney who made it possible benefits too.
>
> What tier makes sense for you right now?"
