## Full Content Draft

### Section 1: Introduction (300 words)

**What This Guide Is:**
This guide prepares you for the marriage-based green card interview (Form I-485 Adjustment of Status). It contains the 50 most frequently asked questions, what USCIS adjudicators are actually evaluating, and practical tips to present your genuine relationship confidently.

**What This Guide Is NOT:**
- Legal advice (we're not lawyers)
- A script to memorize (authenticity matters)
- A guarantee of approval (no one can promise that)
- A replacement for an immigration attorney

**Who This Is For:**
- Couples with an interview scheduled in the next 30-90 days
- Applicants who want to feel prepared, not just informed
- Anyone who's Googled "green card interview questions" at 2am

**The Core Truth:**
The interview isn't a memory test. Adjudicators aren't checking if you know your spouse's social security number by heart. They're assessing whether your relationship is genuine. Your job isn't to have perfect answers—it's to be authentically yourselves while clearly demonstrating your bona fide marriage.

### Section 2: How the Interview Works (500 words)

**Before the Interview:**
- Arrive 15-30 minutes early
- You'll go through security (like airport TSA)
- Wait in a lobby until your name is called
- Both spouses attend together (usually)

**The Interview Room:**
- Small office, desk, two chairs facing the officer
- Officer has your entire file in front of them
- Interview lasts 15-45 minutes typically
- Officer is professional, not adversarial (usually)

**Interview Structure:**
1. **Oath**: You'll swear to tell the truth
2. **Document verification**: Officer confirms identity, reviews forms
3. **Basic questions**: How did you meet? When did you marry?
4. **Relationship questions**: Details about your life together
5. **Consistency check**: Questions to verify stories align
6. **Closing**: Officer tells you decision or next steps

**Possible Outcomes:**
- **Approved on the spot**: Best case, get stamp in passport same day
- **Approved pending background check**: Common, 2-4 weeks for card
- **Request for Evidence (RFE)**: Need to submit more documents
- **Stokes Interview**: Separated interviews (rare, for suspected fraud)
- **Denied**: Rare for legitimate couples, can appeal

### Section 4: What Adjudicators Are Really Looking For (400 words)

**They're NOT looking for:**
- Perfect answers
- Memorized responses
- Identical stories word-for-word
- Knowledge of obscure facts

**They ARE looking for:**
- **Consistency**: Stories that align on major facts
- **Specificity**: Details that only someone who lives with you would know
- **Natural delivery**: Answers that flow, not recited
- **Emotional authenticity**: Love, humor, occasional frustration—real relationships
- **Body language**: Eye contact, physical comfort with each other

**The Fraud Detection Mindset:**
Adjudicators interview hundreds of couples. They've seen every scam. They're watching for:
- Stories that sound scripted
- Couples who seem uncomfortable together
- Major timeline inconsistencies
- Lack of knowledge about basic daily life
- Nervous over-explanation of simple questions

**The Truth:**
If your relationship is real, the interview is about presentation, not deception. You're not hiding anything—you're demonstrating what's already true.

---

### Section 5: Red Flags That Trigger Scrutiny (300 words)

**Timeline Red Flags:**
- Met and married within weeks
- Long-distance relationship with few visits
- Large age gap (20+ years)
- Previous immigration violations

**Document Red Flags:**
- No joint financial accounts
- Separate addresses ever
- No photos together
- Missing evidence of shared life

**Interview Red Flags:**
- Contradicting each other on basic facts
- Not knowing spouse's daily routine
- Unable to describe home together
- Appearing rehearsed or robotic
- Excessive nervousness (beyond normal)

**What To Do If You Have Red Flags:**
Don't panic. Many legitimate couples have these factors. Prepare to explain them naturally:
- Age gap? "We met at [context], connection was instant"
- Quick marriage? "When you know, you know—here's our story"
- Long distance? "Here's our visit history and how we stayed connected"

---

### Section 6: Couples Interview Strategy (300 words)

**If Interviewed Together:**
- Let each person answer questions directed at them
- Don't interrupt or correct each other
- It's okay to add details, not contradict
- Make eye contact with officer, not just spouse

**If Separated (Stokes Interview):**
- Stay calm—this isn't accusation, it's verification
- Answer honestly, don't try to guess what spouse said
- Minor inconsistencies are normal
- Focus on your truth, not matching perfectly

**Practice Tip:**
Have a friend ask you questions separately, then compare notes. Identify where you naturally differ and discuss.
