### Step 3: Post on Reddit (20 mins)

**Subreddit Priority:**

3. r/greencard (10K members) - Niche but relevant

**Post Title Options:**

- `The interview prep resource I wish existed when we were preparing`

**Post Body:**
```
Hey r/immigration,

We went through the marriage green card interview last [month]. The anxiety beforehand was brutal—waking up at 3am, Googling every possible question, arguing during practice.

After we passed, I compiled everything into a guide:

**What's inside:**
- 50 most common questions (organized: How You Met, Daily Life, Finances, etc.)
- What adjudicators are ACTUALLY evaluating with each question
- Red flags that trigger scrutiny (and how to address them)
- Couples strategy: interviewed together vs. separated
- Day-of checklist

**What it's NOT:**
- Legal advice (I'm not a lawyer)
- A script to memorize (authenticity > perfection)
- A guarantee (no one can promise that)

It's $9 on Gumroad: [YOUR LINK]

If $9 is genuinely a barrier, DM me—I'll send it free. I made this to help people, not gatekeep.

Good luck to everyone with interviews coming up. The nerves are normal. You've got this.

*Standard disclaimer: Not legal advice, consult an immigration attorney for your specific situation.*
```

**Engagement Strategy:**
- Respond to every comment within 1 hour
- Be genuinely helpful, not salesy
- Offer free copy to first 3 commenters who say they can't afford it (builds goodwill, gets testimonials)

---

### Step 4: Backup Channels (if time permits)

**Twitter/X:**
```
I just published a guide for marriage green card interviews:

50 questions + what adjudicators actually look for

If you or someone you know has an interview coming up:
[link]

$9. Should've existed before we went through this.
```
Hashtags: #immigration #greencard #USCIS #immigrationlaw

**Facebook Groups:**
Search: "green card interview" "immigration help" "USCIS"
Join, then post similar to Reddit (follow group rules)

## CONTINGENCY: IF REDDIT POST REMOVED

Some subreddits don't allow self-promotion. If removed:

1. **Reframe as resource sharing:**
   - Remove price mention
   - Say "I made this free, DM for link"
   - Then DM with Gumroad link

2. **Try r/ImmigrationCanada, r/ukvisa** (different demo but validates concept)

3. **Go direct to forums:**
   - VisaJourney.com forums
   - ImmiHelp.com forums
   - These allow more promotion
