## Immigracious: The Problem We're Solving

**Version:** 0.1.0
**Date:** December 12, 2025

## The Problem Statement

> **Marriage-based green card applicants have no way to realistically practice for their interview—the most high-stakes 15-30 minutes of their immigration journey—leading to preventable denials, unnecessary anxiety, and broken families.**

---

## The Current Reality

### What Happens Today

1. **Couples Google "green card interview questions"**
   - Find generic lists of 50-100 questions
   - No context on what the adjudicator is actually looking for
   - No way to practice answering out loud
   - No feedback on their answers

2. **They practice with each other (maybe)**
   - One person reads questions, other answers
   - No realism—partner knows the answers
   - No stress simulation
   - Couples often argue during practice

3. **They hire an immigration lawyer ($2,000-$10,000)**
   - Lawyers focus on paperwork, not interview prep
   - Maybe one 30-minute "prep session"
   - Lawyer isn't trained in interview simulation
   - Most prep happens via email or document review

4. **They show up nervous and underprepared**
   - First time answering questions out loud to a stranger
   - Stress response kicks in
   - Minor inconsistencies become red flags
   - Confident couples pass; nervous couples get RFEs or denials

### The Stakes

- **2.1 million** marriage-based green card applications pending (2024)
- **~15%** receive Requests for Evidence (RFE) requiring additional proof
- **~3-5%** are denied outright
- A denial means: deportation risk, family separation, starting over
- Average wait time: **12-24 months** just to get the interview

### The Emotional Weight

```
"We've been together 7 years. We have a child together.
And in 15 minutes, a stranger will decide if our family stays together
based on whether we answer questions the same way."

— Reddit r/immigration, 2024

## Why This Problem Persists

### 1. Legal Liability Concerns
Immigration attorneys can't "coach" answers—it borders on fraud. So they under-prepare clients to avoid liability.

### 2. No Realistic Practice Environment
You can't practice "being questioned by a government official" with your spouse. The dynamic is fundamentally different.

### 3. Information Asymmetry
Adjudicators are trained to detect fraud. Applicants don't know what they're actually looking for. The asymmetry creates anxiety.

### 4. Technology Gap
Immigration tech focuses on forms and documents. No one has built for the *human experience* of the interview.

### 5. Market Perception
"Interview prep" sounds like luxury. Couples don't budget for it until it's too late.

---

## The Insight

**The interview isn't a knowledge test. It's a authenticity test.**

Adjudicators aren't checking if you know your spouse's birthday. They're watching for:
- Micro-expressions when couples contradict each other
- Hesitation patterns that suggest rehearsed vs. genuine answers
- Body language and eye contact
- The *texture* of authentic relationship details

**You can't study for authenticity. But you can practice expressing it.**

The couples who pass aren't "better prepared" in the traditional sense. They're more *comfortable* being themselves under pressure. They've externalized their nervousness through practice.

## The Solution Hypothesis

> **An AI-powered voice interview simulator that recreates the stress and dynamics of a real USCIS interview, allowing couples to practice until the nervousness fades and authenticity emerges.**

### Why AI + Voice?

1. **Realistic pressure**: Speaking to an AI adjudicator creates real stress response
2. **Unlimited practice**: No scheduling, no cost per session
3. **Objective feedback**: AI can identify inconsistencies couples miss
4. **Couples mode**: Both spouses answer, AI tracks alignment
5. **Private & safe**: Practice embarrassing questions without judgment

### Why Now?

1. **Voice AI matured**: Real-time STT + TTS now viable at low cost
2. **Speaker diarization works**: Can tell who's speaking in 2-person interview
3. **LLMs understand context**: GPT-4o can play a convincing adjudicator
4. **Distribution unlocked**: SEO + content can reach every anxious applicant

## The Anti-Goals

What we are NOT building:

1. **Not legal advice**: We don't tell people what to say
2. **Not document prep**: We don't fill out forms
3. **Not a guarantee**: We can't promise approval
4. **Not a replacement for lawyers**: We complement, not compete
5. **Not immigration policy advocacy**: We're pragmatic, not political

---

## The Moral Imperative

Every year, legitimate couples are denied because they *seemed* nervous or inconsistent—not because their marriage is fake.

Meanwhile, fraud cases pass because they were *better prepared* by unscrupulous consultants.

The system rewards preparation, but preparation tools aren't equally accessible.

**We're democratizing interview preparation. That's it. That's the mission.**

**Document Status:** Foundation document. Refine as user research deepens.
