```

### Post Body (copy exactly)

```
Hey r/immigration,

My wife and I went through the marriage green card interview. The anxiety beforehand was brutal—waking up at 3am Googling every possible question, arguing during practice sessions.

After we passed, I compiled everything we learned into a guide.

**What's inside:**
- 50 most common questions (organized by category: How You Met, Daily Life, Finances, etc.)
- What adjudicators are ACTUALLY evaluating with each question
- Red flags that trigger extra scrutiny (and how to address them)
- Couples strategy: interviewed together vs. separated
- Day-of checklist

**What it's NOT:**
- Legal advice (I'm not a lawyer)
- A script to memorize (authenticity beats perfection)
- A guarantee (no one can promise that)

It's $9 on Gumroad: [YOUR LINK HERE]

If $9 is genuinely a barrier, DM me and I'll send it free. I made this to help people, not gatekeep.

Good luck to everyone with interviews coming up. The nerves are normal. You've got this.

## CONTINGENCY: IF REDDIT POST REMOVED

Some subreddits block self-promotion. If removed:

**Option 1: Reframe as free resource**
- Remove price mention from post
- Say "I made this, DM for the link"
- Send Gumroad link in DMs

**Option 2: Try alternative subreddits**
- r/ImmigrationCanada (validates concept)
- r/ukvisa (different demo)

**Option 3: Go to forums**
- VisaJourney.com forums
- ImmiHelp.com forums
- These allow more promotion

## ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY

After posting:
1. Respond to EVERY comment within 1 hour
2. Be genuinely helpful, not salesy
3. Offer free copy to first 3 people who say they can't afford it
4. Ask for feedback from anyone who buys

---

## SUCCESS = 1 SALE
