**Date:** December 12, 2025
**Research Method:** Temporal Metacognition (verified via web search)
**Confidence Level:** High (government sources + industry data)

## Executive Summary

The U.S. immigration market represents a massive, underserved opportunity. With **1.17 million green cards** issued annually, **818,500 naturalizations**, and **4 million people** in official backlogs, the addressable market is enormous. Marriage-based green cards alone represent **~300,000 interviews annually**—and NO competitor specifically serves this niche.

**Key Finding:** Marriage-based green card interview preparation is a clear blue ocean. Competitors focus on citizenship tests, tourist visas, or general immigration services. None specialize in the high-anxiety, high-stakes marriage-based green card interview.

## Question 1: How Many Green Card Types Exist?

### Official Categories (per USCIS)

| Category | Description | FY 2024 Volume |
|----------|-------------|----------------|

**Total: 6 main pathways** with dozens of subcategories.

## Question 3: How Many People Become Citizens Per Year?

### Naturalization Statistics (Verified Data)

| Fiscal Year | Naturalizations | Notable |
|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| FY 2019 | 843,593 | Pre-pandemic baseline |
| FY 2020 | 625,400 | COVID impact |
| FY 2021 | 855,000 | Recovery |
| FY 2022 | 967,400 | Record high |
| FY 2023 | 878,500 | Normalized |
| FY 2024 | 818,500 | 12% above pre-pandemic |

**Source:** USCIS Naturalization Statistics

### Additional Data Points

- **9 million people** currently eligible for naturalization (haven't applied yet)
- **Citizenship test pass rate:** 95.7% overall, 88% on first attempt
- **Average wait:** 8-12 months from application to oath ceremony

### Market Implication
The citizenship test market (~800,000/year) is **larger** than we initially thought, but has **more competition** (immiprep.ai, ymgrad.com focus here). Pass rates are high (95.7%), so anxiety is lower than green card interviews.
