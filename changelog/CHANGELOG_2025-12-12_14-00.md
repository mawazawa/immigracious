## Decisions Made

### D001: Voice AI Stack Selection
**Decision:** Hybrid architecture (Deepgram + OpenAI + ElevenLabs)
**Rationale:**
- Deepgram: Best-in-class real-time diarization ($0.0077/min)
- OpenAI GPT-4o: Fast LLM for adjudicator logic (~$0.06/min)
- ElevenLabs: Most natural TTS ($0.08/min)
- Total: ~$0.15/min (75% cheaper than OpenAI Realtime alone)
**Alternatives Rejected:**
- OpenAI Realtime (simpler but 2x cost)
- Hume EVI 3 (no diarization)
- Retell AI (platform lock-in)

### D002: Design Philosophy
**Decision:** Modern + Friendly + AI-forward + Trustworthy
**Inspirations:** Linear.app, Fey.com, Aceternity UI, Apple HIG
**Rationale:** Immigration is emotional; UX must convey trust while feeling premium

### D003: First Dollar Strategy
**Decision:** $9 PDF guide on Gumroad, distributed via Reddit
**Rationale:**
- Validates willingness to pay
- Creates email list for launch
- Content asset for future SEO
- Fastest path to revenue

### D004: Company Structure
**Decision:** Zero-Person Company with AI C-Suite
**Structure:**
- President (Human): Mathieu Wauters - Strategic direction, ethics, final authority
- CSO (Claude Opus 4.5): Strategy, planning, coding, skills
- CVO (Gemini 3.0 Pro): Vision, synthesis, long-form analysis
- CMIO (Grok 4.1): Real-time market intelligence, speed
- COO (GPT 5.1): Operations, execution, process

None currently.

## Mid-Session Update: Brand Rename

**Time:** ~14:30
**Change:** ImmiGreat → Immigracious

**Reason:** Discovered immigreat.ai is an existing immigration course platform (10,000+ users). Brand collision risk.

**Actions Taken:**
- ✅ Created `research/competitor-intelligence/COMPETITOR_LANDSCAPE.md`
- ✅ Renamed all references from "ImmiGreat" to "Immigracious" across 7 files
- ✅ Documented competitor landscape (6 competitors analyzed)

**Key Insight:** NO competitor focuses on marriage-based green card interviews. Our niche is clear and uncontested.
